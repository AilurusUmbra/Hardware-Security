The challenge is 2 bits (select lines) and the response is 28 bits displayed on the 7 segment display. 

L16 switch is enable for the ring oscillator.

V10 and U11 are select lines s0 and s1 respectively.

A clear signal is not yet added. For a new challenge please reprogram the FPGA with the bit file. Clear will be added shortly.
